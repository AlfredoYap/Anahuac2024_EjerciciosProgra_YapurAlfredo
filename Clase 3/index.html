			<p>Future house pioneer Don Diablo says he’s been touring “more than ever” over the past 12 months. That’s meant club shows at Exchange LA, Pacha Ibiza, New City Gas in Montréal, Echostage in Washington, DC and London’s E1, and festival slots at Hungary’s Balaton Sound, Romania’s Neversea, Creamfields in the UK, and Tomorrowland’s original Belgian edition and its Brazilian offshoot (amongst many others). Don’s been busy in the studio too, with a new album on the horizon, and “a heap load of singles, remixes and edits to quench the fans’ thirst as much as possible” dropping throughout the year. This has included the roaring ‘Extended VIP’ of his collab with Azteck, ‘You’re Not Alone’, released via Don’s Hexagon imprint, the sultry ‘Feelings’ for Virgin, and most recently the glittering ‘Let Me Love You’ for Spinnin’.
			</p>
			<p>Don’s empire has long extended beyond just his musical output and this year his popular Hexagon clothing line saw a new drop featuring a collaboration with his favourite TV show, ’80s-set teen sci-fi horror phenomenon, Stranger Things. (He’s previously collab’d on an official Star Wars line, a movie franchise that Don is a super-fan of). And having moved into the world of visual art, he’s also “been busy in my atelier working on new installations and art pieces for upcoming art exhibitions in 2024 and beyond”
